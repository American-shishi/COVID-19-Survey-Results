The impact financially hasn’t personally been that great , however, for others it has been detrimental. We have cut our normal staffing matrix significantly to about 60%. This sometimes is a negative impact considering the dynamics of an ER , that can go from 0-60 in a matter of minutes creating challenges to accommodate a surge of patients all at once, when we aren’t staffed with our regular staffing. This pandemic is a fluid situation, we are learning as we go. The treatment modalities and processes for handling suspect PUI patients is an evolving process daily, especially with testing mediums. We have narrowed that down and now only have two tests both rapid, one 15 min turn around the other 30-60min that are offered at our facility. I’m concerned that we are not as prepared as we need to be regarding PPE availability and for a second wave that will most likely see possibly during the flu season. We still don’t have proper N95 duck bill masks for those who cannot wear the traditional N95 we have been fit tested for. 
I feel the stay at home order has helped with flattening the curve but also feel that it’s time to lift restrictions and allow people to do what makes sense to them and get our economy back on track. We need to approach this scientifically, not politically! We need to develop herd immunity and Continue to research and develop vaccines. "
